Better Custom Classes for Gutenberg adds a new custom classes pane in the block options panel. This field behaves similar to tags for a better custom class UX.

== Description ==
Adds an extra "Custom Classes" pane to gutenberg blocks that behaves similar to tags. This allows for easy entry, deletion, and managment of utility classes on your blocks. A regex validator highlights classes that may be invalid. A "Copy All" button is also added for quickly transferring classes between blocks.
On deactivation, classes will persist, but in the legacy Custom Class field under the advanced pane.

== Installation ==
1. Extract better-custom-classes-for-gutenberg.zip
1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==
1. Easily viewing classes with the Custom Class Pane
2. An invalid class highlighted where the user added a period
